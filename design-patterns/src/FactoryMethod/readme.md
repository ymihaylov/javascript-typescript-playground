# Intent
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

# The problem
- We have a Logistic company which is working with RoadLogistics. But the factory is growing and we want to start with Ships as well.
